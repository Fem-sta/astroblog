For this project, the inspiration came from a similar motion piece that emphasized sound design.

The SFX and audio layers played a major role in shaping the motion, influencing rotations and other transformations in ways I hadn’t explored before. Knowing that audio would be the primary focus, I chose to model a water bottle in Blender. I designed the image textures in Figma and referenced lighting setups from Pinterest.

I wanted strong contrast with dark, soft shadows, so I used large area lights in Blender positioned very close to the main subject. Projects like this can easily become unending or directionless without a clear storyboard and an emphasis on simplicity.

Once I established rotation as the primary motion, I introduced scaling and a small Geometry Nodes group to handle the array spin.
